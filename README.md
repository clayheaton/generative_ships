### Procedurally Generated Ships

This is a [Processing](http://www.processing.org) sketch that allows users to play with parameters and constraints on a simple prototype of a spaceship generator. Processing is free to download [here](https://processing.org/download/).

Download this repository either to run the code in Processing or for a pre-built executable of the code. 

Windows Users: unzip `generative_ships_windows.zip` for the executable.

MacOS Users: unzip `generative_ships_macos.zip` for the Mac app.
